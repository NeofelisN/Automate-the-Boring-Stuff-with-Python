## Why I'm doing this
I'm currently learning to code with Python using Al Sweigart's [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/).
These are my attempts at writing code to solve the various exercises in the book.

Hopefully this will be useful for my fellow beginners =)
